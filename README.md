# Bank Account

## Makers Academy example tech test

This is a practice tech test, in which I use TDD and OO design to build a simple program to provide a user with an on-screen print out of their bank account activity, as a simple bank statement.

I have decided to use Python for this project, in order to practice using TDD and OO skills that I have learned in Ruby and JavaScript, in another language.
